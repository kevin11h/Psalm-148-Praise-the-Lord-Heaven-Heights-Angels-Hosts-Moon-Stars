Psalms 148:1-12 ERV Praise the LORD! Angels above, praise the LORD from heaven! Praise him, all you angels! Praise him, all his army! Sun and moon, praise him! Stars and lights in the sky, praise him! Praise him, highest heaven! Waters above the sky, praise him! Let them praise the LORDâ€™s name, because he gave the command and created them all! He made all these continue forever. He made the laws that will never end. Everything on earth, praise him! Great sea animals and all the oceans, praise the LORD! Praise him, fire and hail, snow and clouds, and the stormy winds that obey him. Praise him, mountains and hills, fruit trees and cedar trees. Praise him, wild animals and cattle, reptiles and birds. Praise him, kings of the earth and all nations, princes and all rulers on earth. Praise him, young men and women, old people and children. https://scpeanutgallery.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/psalm-148.jpg?w=300&amp;h=282
